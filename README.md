 Create a company web site 
</summary>
  The web site must contain the following sections:
  
  Home (the main page)
  
  About (Description about the company)
  
  Products/Services (The products/services that you are going to sell)
  
  News (Latest news about the company, products, etc.)
  
  Contacts (Company contacts)
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    Add a secure section in the web site.
  </summary>
  The secure section holds a document listing the current users of your web site. 
 
The secure section requires login by an administrator. You can use the id "admin".

</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    Use web cookies technologies to track the last five previously visited products.
  </summary>
  Modify the Products/Services section and add ten products/services in your company web site.
 
Each product/service should have their own page with descriptions and pictures.

Add a link in the Products/Services section to show the last five previously visited products.

  <summary>
    Use CURL to implement the following
  </summary>
  For each company web site, create a php web app/link that shows a list of users from your own company.
 
Assume we have a group of 3 (Company A, Company B and Company C). Thus, we have

list_of_users_A that is stored in a database A in Company A host system

list_of_users_B that is stored in a database B in Company B host system

list_of_users_C that is stored in a database C in Company C host system

Each company web site needs to create a web link that shows list_of_users from all companies. You can access your local list_of_user via normal php database call, but you need to access remote company's database via CURL calls.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>
    Create a mySQL database for your company web site
  </summary>
  Create a User section/tab in your web site.
 
The User section should link to two forms:

User creation form with all the fields above.

User search form allowing search by names, email or phone numbers.

  <summary>
    Cross Domain Enterprise Online Market Place
  </summary>
  Using the various lab exercises you have so far, each of your group member has successfully "opened" up his/her own web company. As a group, all of the members need to work together and form an online market place. The online market place contains web sites from all the group members' companies, and it has to provide the following functions:
  
Creation of a user (for the whole market place).

Tracking of where the user has visited within the market place (in each of the member company).

Ability for the user to add a review and rating for any product/service offered in the market place.

Presentation of the top five products/services in each member company. (Each group can decide what top five means - most visited, best review, etc.)

Presentation of the top five products/services in the whole market place. (Each group can decide what top five means - most visited, best review, etc.)
